It is developed by the Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. It\u0026rsquo;s a really useful tool that allows for automated processes as well as manual interventions, mainly through it\u0026rsquo;s GUI, Freeview.\nI started using FreeSurfer and Freeview last year and, albeit the documentation being quite thorough, I had a harder time navigating the website than I expected.\nSo here are a few tricks to make your handling FreeSurfer\u0026rsquo;s GUI, Freeview, easier and faster!\n1. Starting Freeview You can start freeview by just typing freeview in your command line and then opening the files you want. Of course, you will be far better off if you write a small script with your usual calls.\nThe command options available for Freeview are:\n   Argument Action     -v load a volume file   -l load a label file   -dti load one or more dti volumes   -f load a surface   -w load waypoints    I have the following script saved under my subjects/ folder:\n export SUBJECT='\u0026lt;subject name\u0026gt;' freeview -v \\ $SUBJECT/mri/T1.mgz \\ $SUBJECT/mri/wm.mgz \\ $SUBJECT/mri/brainmask.mgz \\ -f \\ $SUBJECT/surf/lh.white:edgecolor=blue \\ $SUBJECT/surf/lh.pial:edgecolor=yellow \\ $SUBJECT/surf/rh.white:edgecolor=blue \\ $SUBJECT/surf/rh.pial:edgecolor=yellow  So, if I want to analyze, let\u0026rsquo;s say, subject bert\u0026rsquo;s images, I just open my freeview.sh script with a text editor and change \u0026lt;subject name\u0026gt; to bert (which is this subject\u0026rsquo;s folder name). Then, I can open a terminal, navigate to my subjects/ folder and type:\n ./freeview.sh  All right, we have opened Freeview and we\u0026rsquo;re ready to start interacting with the GUI!\n2. Check out the available Freeview keyboard shortcuts! This single trick will save you an amazing amount of time. I have been working with CentOs and a few shortcuts I have found by experimenting are:\n   Command Action     Alt + N Navigate Tool   Ctrl + E Recon Edit Tool   Alt + E Voxel Edit Tool   Ctrl + F Toggle all surfaces   Alt + C Alternate between volumes/surfaces   Ctrl + P Toggle left side menu   Ctrl + T Point set edit   Ctrl + R Reset View   Alt + X Show sagital images   Alt + Y Show axial images   Alt + Z Show coronal images   Alt + A/D Decrease/Increase opacity of currently highlighted volume   Ctrl + D Hide brainmask   Alt + F Toggle currently highlighted surface   Alt + U Show cursor    You\u0026rsquo;ll find other shortcuts under this link. I\u0026rsquo;ll copy the most useful ones here for convenience:\n   Command Action     Ctrl + S Save   Ctrl + Z Undo   Ctrl + Q Exit Freeview   Ctrl + O Load Volume   Up/Down Arrow Keys or PageUp/PageDown Change slice   Scroll or Drag-Right-Click Zoom In/Zoom Out   Ctrl + Up/Down/Left/Right (arrow keys) Moving volume (Panning)   Alt + V Toggle currently highlighted volume   Shift-Drag Left Click Adjust Contrast/Brightness   Zoom in at current location Ctrl-Left-Click (or scroll)   Zoom out at current location Ctrl-Right-Click (or scroll)    When you\u0026rsquo;re in Voxel/Recon/ROI edit mode:\n   Command Action     Draw / Fill Left Click   Erase / Erase Fill Shift+Left Click    That conludes this short tutorial about Freeview!
